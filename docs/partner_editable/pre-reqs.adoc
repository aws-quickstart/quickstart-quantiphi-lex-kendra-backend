==== Prepare for the deployment

To deploy the stack, you need to provide an S3 bucket name which contains the documents that will be indexed by Kendra to provide answers to user's question. This S3 bucket is your document repository for the Lex ChatBot.

Please make sure you have this S3 bucket ready with necessary documents, before deploying the stack.
